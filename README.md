#pubvendors-tool

Simple electron app that loads the default https://vendorlist.consensu.org/vendorlist.json.

Pick which vendors you want from the table and save a new pubvendors.json file with only the vendors you use.

Uses a stripped down version of https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate
